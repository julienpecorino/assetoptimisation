Some really usful command lines for: 

ðŸ˜Ž Converting .png ot .jpg

ðŸ˜Ž Renaming files

ðŸ˜Ž Resizing file

ðŸ˜Ž Compressing...

This is using strayghtaway npm as task runner (no need grunt or gulp), to use a command simply type: â€˜npm run rename-fileâ€™.
The scripts are inside the package.json, donâ€™t forget to do: â€™npm installâ€™ to dowload all dependencies.
