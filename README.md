# Asset Optimisations
Some really useful command lines for: 

😎 Converting .png or .jpg

😎 Formating files name

😎 Renaming files

😎 Resizing file

🤜 Compressing png or jpg

This is using npm as task runner (no need grunt or gulp), to use it, type the command: ‘npm run rename-file’.
Scripts are inside the package.json, don’t forget to do: ’npm install’ to dowload all dev dependencies.
